### Supernatural & Inheritance

***
## Introduction  
At the Codecademy Guild of the Supernatural, there are three ranks of magicians.
They rank from least to most powerful: Pupils, Mages, and Archmages

Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-supernatural-inheritance)

## Objectives
In this project, youâ€™ll be developing a system in C# to track the weather magicians in the guild and their spells.

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download this project individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandox-csharp.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/
```

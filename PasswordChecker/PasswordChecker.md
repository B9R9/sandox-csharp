Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-password-checker)

## Objectives
The program will ask the user to input a password, and using conditional logic and control flow, it will rate the password.
## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download the Password Checker individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandox-csharp.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/PasswordChecker
```

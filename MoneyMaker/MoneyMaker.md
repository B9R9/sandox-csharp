### Money Maker

***
## Introduction  
a program in which a user enters an amount and gets the minimum number of coins that equal that value. 

Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-money-maker-live)

## Objectives
This project will get you comfortable with division (/), rounding down (Math.Floor()), and modulo (%): You can find how many coins 
“fit” into an amount by dividing the amount by the coin value, rounding down, and finding the remainder.

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download the MoneyMaker individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandox-csharp.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/MoneyMaker
```

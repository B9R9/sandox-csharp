### Architect Arithmetic

***
## Introduction  
In this project, you’ll use methods to build a program that calculates the material cost for any architect’s floor plan. 

Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-architect-arithmetic)

## Objectives
You’ll be defining area methods like Circle() and Rect()

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download the Architect Arithmetic  individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandox-csharp.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/
```

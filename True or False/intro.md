### True opr False

***
## Introduction  
You’re taking an interactive quiz written in C#. 
Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-true-or-false)

## Objectives
In this project, you’ll build a C# program that presents a quiz the right way: using arrays and loops, it will check the
format of user input and repeat the question if the format is incorrect. After the quiz is complete, it will check the user’s
responses against the correct answers and present a score.
## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download True or False project individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandox-csharp.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/
```

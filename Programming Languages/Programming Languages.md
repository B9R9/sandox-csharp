### Programming Languages

***
## Introduction  
Do you know when C# was invented? How about your other favorite programming languages, like JavaScript, Ruby, and R?
Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-programming-languages)

## Objectives
In this project youâ€™ll be using lists and LINQ to search a database for answers!

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download this project individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandox-csharp.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/
```

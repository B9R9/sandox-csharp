### Choose Your Own Adventure

***
## Introduction  
n this project, you’ll use logic and conditional statements to write a classic text-based Choose Your Own Adventure Game. 
Depending on what choices your user makes, the program will have a different result

Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-choose-your-own-adventure)

## Objectives
While we’re only working with text, the principles of user input and control flow are used to build even highly advanced games.

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download the Choose Your Own Adventure individually at the moment.

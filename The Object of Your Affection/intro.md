### The Object Of Your Affection

***
## Introduction  
Your friend is building a new match-making service: The Object of Your Affection or OOYA for short
(don’t worry, you still have time to convince them to change the name).
Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-dating-profile)

## Objectives
With your new understanding of C# objects and classes, your friend thought you could build a pretty well-organized system of dating profiles.

Your first step? Build a Profile class that allows users to generate profile objects.

The Profile should store the following information:

- User’s name
- User’s age
- User’s city
- User’s country
- User’s pronouns
- User’s hobbies
And this is how users should be able to interact with their own profiles:

Create a new profile with some information
- Add hobbies
- View profile

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download The object of your Affection project individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandox-csharp.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/
```

## Introduction  
Mad Libs are short stories with blanks for the player to fill in that represent different parts of speech.
The end result is a really hilarious and strange story.

## Objectives  
Mad Libs require: A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words). Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

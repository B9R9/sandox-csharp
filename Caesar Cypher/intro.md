### Caesar Cipher

***
## Introduction  
As the team’s C# expert, you have been asked to write a cipher: a tool to encrypt text, making it unreadable to other teams.
You’ve decided to implement the Caesar Cipher, which was used by the Roman Empire to encode military secrets.

Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-caesar-cipher)

## Objectives
Take every letter of your message and shift it three places to the right.
For example, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and “attack” becomes “dwwdfn”.

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download the Caesar Cipher individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandox-csharp.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/
```

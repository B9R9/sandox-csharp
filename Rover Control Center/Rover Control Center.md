### Rover Control Center

***
## Introduction  
Welcome to SPACE: Space Program for Aeronautical Collection and Exploration. 
You are in charge of the Rover Control Center. All rovers on Moon and Mars are under your direction!
Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-rover-control-center)

## Objectives
This project will show you some ways in which references, inheritance, interfaces, and arrays can help you be a better C# programmer.  

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download this project individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandox-csharp.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/
```

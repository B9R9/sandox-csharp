### App Interfaces

***
## Introduction  
The team at Computron Computing has asked you to join their product team to develop the hottest new Computron computer. 
Youâ€™ll be responsible for building some of the standard apps on this new machine, specifically the to-do list and the password 
manager.  
Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-app-interfaces)

## Objectives
At this point in development you have two classes started: TodoList representing the to-do list application and PasswordManager 
representing the password manager. In order to work within the Computron system, every app must have a display and reset feature. 
In other words, each class will need to implement the IDisplayable and IResetable interfaces.  

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download this project individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandox-csharp.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/
```

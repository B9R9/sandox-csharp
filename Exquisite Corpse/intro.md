### Exquisite Corpse

***
## Introduction  
n the game Exquisite Corpse, participants draw either a head, body, or feet of a creature.
The players don’t know how their part of the body connects to the other two, until the drawing is finished and revealed.
Project from Codecademy.[Here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-c-sharp/projects/csharp-exquisite-corpse)

## Objectives
For this project, you’ll write a program that mimics the Exquisite Corpse game. Using methods, you’ll be able to randomly
combine different parts of ASCII characters so they create a new creature.

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo. 
This does not allow you to download the Exquiste Corpse individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandox-csharp.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/
```
